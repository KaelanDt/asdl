# ASDL: Automatic Second-order Differentiation Library

NOTE: this branch `dev-grad-maker` is under development and will be merged to `master` branch soon.

ASDL is an extension library of PyTorch to easily 
calculate second-order matrices
and apply gradient preconditioning for deep neural networks.

## Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kazukiosawa/asdl.git
cd asdl
pip install -e .
```
(`asdl` will be available in PyPI soon.)
