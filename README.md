# ASD(FGHJK)L
The library is called "ASDL", which stands for **A**utomatic **S**econd-order **D**ifferentiation (for **F**isher, **G**radient covariance, **H**essian, **J**acobian, and **K**ernel) **L**ibrary.

You can import `asdfghjkl` by scrolling your finger on a QWERTY keyboard :innocent:
```python
import asdfghjkl
```
